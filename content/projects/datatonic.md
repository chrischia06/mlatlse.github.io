Under an industry mentorship programme with Datatonic, members implemented an end to end machine learning model, and presented a <a href = 'https://gitlab.com/mlatlse/amazon-project/blob/master/poster.pdf'> poster at LSE SEDS 2019 </a> 


You can see the finished product <a href = 'https://mlatlse.kszk.eu/'> here </a> and view the source code for this project <a href = 'https://gitlab.com/mlatlse/amazon-project'> here </a>




If you're interested in working on a new project for the 2019-2020 year, then we would love to hear from you. Prerequisites include: good knowledge of Python with understanding of numpy, pandas, and basics of TensorFlow. Previous experience with machine learning projects is a plus.

You should be able to dedicate 5 hours a week of work to the project and to be able to work in a team.

We want to present the project at the end of the year to the LSE SEDS Annual Summit as we did in 2019. Click here for more information on LSE SEDS.
